KOReader patches, likely not useful for anybody else.

# [2-custom-reader-header.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-custom-reader-header.lua)

Adds a custom header with "Author â€“ Title" in left corner and "Battery % | Clock" in right corner. Needs localization if you're not Swedish. It also comes with a few folder rules which, again, is (likely) not useful for anybody else.

# [2-header-manga.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-header-manga.lua)

Same as the above, but smaller font and with "current page/total pages" and "pages left", as well as an added thin line beneath 

# [2-footer-margin.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-footer-margin.lua)

Makes the manga/comic fill the entire screen beneath the header. Meant to be combined with [2-header-manga.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-header-manga.lua). Also meant for screen size 1264 x 1680.

# [2-footer-info-progress.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-footer-info-progress.lua)

Custom footer with "Chapter name" in left corner, "Current page/total pages", "Pages left in chapter", "Pages left in book", and "Percentage read" in right corner. Also a thin progress bar beneath.
