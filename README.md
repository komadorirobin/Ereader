Ereader nonsense. Not useful for anybody else.

# [2-custom-reader-header.lua](https://github.com/komadorirobin/Ereader/blob/main/2-custom-reader-header.lua)

Adds a custom header with "Author â€“ Title" in left corner and "Battery % | Clock" in right corner. Needs localization if you're not Swedish. It also comes with a few folder rules which, again, is (likely) not useful for anybody else.
